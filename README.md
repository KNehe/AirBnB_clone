# AirBnB clone - The console

## Project Description

- A command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects. The main purpose is to create all classes for AirBnB(`User`, `City`, `Place...) that inherit from a `BaseModel, create a class that takes care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of instances, an
abstracted storage engine, and unit tests to validate all classes and the storage engine.

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
